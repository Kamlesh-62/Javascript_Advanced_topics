# Advanced JavaScript Question Set

1. **Prototype Chain & Inheritance**  
   How would you architect a scalable inheritance model by leveraging JavaScript’s prototype chain, and what are the trade-offs versus ES6 `class` syntax?

2. **Execution Context & `this` Binding**  
   In a mixed-module environment, describe how you would ensure consistent `this` binding across callbacks, arrow functions, and dynamically bound methods.

3. **Memory Management & Garbage Collection**  
   What strategies would you implement to proactively detect and mitigate memory leaks in a long-running Node.js process? Illustrate with code snippets using WeakMap or FinalizationRegistry.

4. **Event Loop & Concurrency Model**  
   Detail the phases of the Node.js event loop. How would you optimize a CPU-bound task without blocking I/O, and what APIs or patterns would you apply?

5. **Asynchronous Patterns: Promises vs. Observables vs. Async Iterators**  
   Compare and contrast Promises, RxJS Observables, and `for await…of` async iterators. In which scenarios would you choose one over the others for enterprise-scale applications?

6. **Generators & Coroutines**  
   How can you implement a custom coroutine scheduler using generator functions? Provide a high-level architecture and discuss performance considerations.

7. **Meta-Programming with `Reflect` & `Proxy`**  
   Propose a use case where you’d deploy `Proxy` handlers and the `Reflect` API to enforce data validation rules at runtime, minimizing boilerplate in your codebase.

8. **Symbols & Private Fields**  
   Explain how Symbols can be utilized to create pseudo-private object properties. What are the implications for API design and extensibility?

9. **Module Systems & Tree-Shaking**  
   In a hybrid codebase mixing CommonJS and ES Modules, how would you structure imports/exports to maximize tree-shaking efficiency in your bundler (e.g., Webpack or Rollup)?

10. **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation & Performance Tuning**  
    Describe how V8’s inline caching and hidden class optimizations work. What code patterns would you avoid to prevent de-optimizations?

11. **Decorators & Metadata (Stage-2+)**  
    Draft an example of a method decorator that logs execution time and attaches metadata to a class method. How would you integrate this into a TypeScript-compiled pipeline?

12. **WebAssembly Interop**  
    Outline a high-level integration strategy for offloading compute-intensive algorithms to WebAssembly modules, ensuring seamless data transfer between JS and WASM.

13. **Event Sourcing & CQRS in JavaScript**  
    How would you implement an event-sourced domain model in JavaScript, ensuring eventual consistency and replayability, while maintaining strong typing and modularity?

14. **Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)**  
    Provide an architectural blueprint for a UI component library built on FRP principles. Which libraries or patterns (e.g., RxJS, Cycle.js) would you leverage?

15. **Security: XSS, CSP & Secure Defaults**  
    What protocols and tools would you integrate to enforce Content Security Policy dynamically and prevent injection attacks across a distributed micro-frontend ecosystem?
